🧮 Beautiful JavaScript Calculator

A clean, modern, and fully functional calculator built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — all inside a single file.
It supports all basic operations, parentheses, percentages, square roots, sign switching, and a history of calculations.
Everything works locally in your browser, no internet or backend required.

✨ Features

Minimal, modern dark-themed interface.

Supports basic arithmetic: +, -, ×, ÷, %.

Parentheses ( and ) for grouped expressions.

Decimal numbers with precision up to 12 digits.

√ (square root) applies to the last result.

± toggles the sign of the last number.

C clears everything; ⌫ deletes the last character.

Keeps a history of the last 12 calculations.

Keyboard support for faster input.

Built-in safety check — only valid math symbols are processed, preventing execution of arbitrary JS code.

100% offline and local — no external requests or data storage.

📁 File

Everything is contained in a single file:

calculator.html

🚀 How to Run

Open any text editor (VS Code, Notepad, Sublime Text, etc.).

Create a new file and paste the calculator code inside it.

Save the file as calculator.html (make sure it ends with .html).

Double-click the file, or open it in your browser (File → Open → calculator.html).

That’s it — your calculator is ready to use!

🧠 How to Use

Click the on-screen buttons or type directly using your keyboard.

Press = or Enter to calculate.

Use C to clear everything.
